A Hund was walking by a baeckerei in Berlin.
The baeckerei gave the Hund a Brot.
The baeckerei was located next to a Flughafen but the Hund probably preferred a Bratwurst, Rammstein music was being played in the baeckerei.
The Hund's owner owned a BMW that was parked on or near a Hauptstrasse.
Henry the hund had a decision to make: go to his owner in the BMW with klimaanlage or go explore.
Henry saw a rather large man in a dirndel and the decision was made for him; he followed the man.
They ended up at a biergarten where there seemed to be a wettbewerbsfaehig beer drinking contest.
