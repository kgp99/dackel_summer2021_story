A Hund was walking by a baeckerei in Berlin.
The baeckerei gave the Hund a Brot.
The baeckerei was located next to a Flughafen but the Hund probably preferred a Bratwurst, Rammstein music was being played in the baeckerei.
The Hund's owner owned a BMW that was parked on or near a Hauptstrasse.
Henry the hund had a decision to make: go to his owner in the BMW with klimaanlage or go explore.
Henry saw a rather large man in a dirndel and the decision was made for him; he followed the man.
They ended up at a biergarten where there seemed to be a wettbewerbsfaehig beer drinking contest.
Both the large man and Henry awoke from a drunken stupor to the sound of musik at the local Biergarten.
Henry and the large man looked at each other in confusion, realizing this wasn't the local Biergarten, this was some Ratskeller they didn't remember going to; seeing their confusion, the Lederhose clad waiter informs them they are in Munich.
